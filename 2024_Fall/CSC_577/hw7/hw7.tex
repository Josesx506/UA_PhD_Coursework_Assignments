Questions from Part A-B were completed in matlab and saved in the \emph{hw7.m} program. The program creates an \emph{output} folder to save images, so that the 
root directory is not always cluttered, and it can be run using the \textit{hw7()} command. This prints the results to coding questions within terminal. All numbers 
are rounded to \emph{3 s.f} for reporting purposes and actual values are more precise.

\begin{enumerate}

    The white light values from the macbeth image were gotten by plotting the macbeth image with \emph{imshow()} and \emph{datacursormode on}. The array limits 
    of the white pixels were selected using colon notation and averaged to get a white light color of $[238,220,250]$.
    
    \item[Q-A2.]
    \ \\
    The same workflow in QA1 was applied to the macbeth solux image (unknown light source) to get a white light color of $[132,159,250]$.
    
    \item[Q-A3.]
    \ \\
    The angular error was estimated by measuring the cosine angles between both color vectors in the previous questions, and the resulting value was $13.8^o$.
    
    \item[Q-A4.]
    \ \\
    The diagonal matrix was used to correct the solux image and the comparison between the solux, corrected, and canonical images are shown in \autoref{fig:Figure1}.

    The derived diagonal matrix (“oracle” color constancy illuminant) was 
    $$
    D = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1.80 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1.39 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    \item[Q-A5.]
    \ \\
    The RMS error was calculated in chromaticity coordinates for all 3 images, using the canonical image as a baseline. The RMS between the canonical and solux 
    image was 0.11. The RMS between the canonical and corrected image dropped to 0.05.

    \item[Q-A6.]
    \ \\
    The angular errors for the MaxRGB algorithm for the Apple, Ball, and Block images were 9.77, 3.71, 19.9 degrees respectively. Personally, it was unclear why 
    the comparison was made with the solux unknown light and not the canonical known light source.

    \item[Q-A7.]
    \ \\
    The workflow in QA5 was repeated for the Apple, Ball, and Block images and the results are shown in \autoref{fig:Figure2}. All images were scaled to a max 
    value of 250 to avoid confusion of pixel brighness, and the RMS values for each image is shown in \autoref{tab:Table1}. The blue channel appears to be 
    overcompensated when the MaxRGB algorithm is used irrespective of the scaling factor used to minimize confusion. This results in a higher RMS error in 
    the corrected \textbf{block} image vs the solux light in \autoref{tab:Table1}. I didn't observe any trend between the angular errors and the RMS errors. 
    This might be because I was comparing it to a fixed macbeth solux illuminant. I also tried comparing it to the canonical macbeth white color estimate, and 
    I didn't observe a correlation.

    The same workflow for the QA7 was repeated for the same images but with the gray-world algorithm. The angular errors for the gray-world method for the Apple, Ball, 
    and Block images were 19.7, 1.40, 23.4 degrees respectively. The RMS error values for each image is shown in \autoref{tab:Table2}. The gray-world method gives 
    lower RMS errors than the MaxRGB algorithm on this dataset and the bright blue channel amplitudes are better compensated for (\autoref{fig:Figure3}). Again, I didn't 
    observe a correlation between the angular and RMS errors. If anything, the Ball image with the worst RMS error had the lowest angular error. Might be because the 
    predicted matrix is close enough to the original matrix reducing the angle between both vectors.

    The sum of squared errors per pixel between two images $I_u \text{ and } I_c$ can be written as 
    \[
    e_i = DI_{u,i} - I_{c,i}
    \]
    where the sum of squared errors between them can be represented as
    \begin{align*}
    L(d_R,d_G,d_B) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \left[(d_R I_{u,iR} - I_{c,iR})^2 + (d_G I_{u,iG} - I_{c,iG})^2 + (d_B I_{u,iB} - I_{c,iB})^2 \right]  \\
    L(d_R,d_G,d_B) &= \sum_{i=1}^n (d_R I_{u,iR} - I_{c,iR})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n (d_G I_{u,iG} - I_{c,iG})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n (d_B I_{u,iB} - I_{c,iB})^2
    \end{align*}
    Getting the derivatives of each channel
    \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial d_R} &= 2 \sum_{i=1}^n (d_R I_{u,iR} - I_{c,iR}) I_{u,iR} = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial d_G} &= 2 \sum_{i=1}^n (d_G I_{u,iG} - I_{c,iG}) I_{u,iG} = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial d_B} &= 2 \sum_{i=1}^n (d_B I_{u,iB} - I_{c,iB}) I_{u,iB} = 0
    \end{align*}
    Divide both sides by the constants. Since zero is on the RHS, they're all equivalent to zero and the resulting expression is 
    \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^n (d_R I_{u,iR} - I_{c,iR}) &= 0 \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n (d_G I_{u,iG} - I_{c,iG}) &= 0 \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n (d_B I_{u,iB} - I_{c,iB}) &= 0
    \end{align*}
    Solving for the diagonal terms gives 
    \begin{align*}
    d_R = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n I_{c,iR}}{\sum_{i=1}^n I_{u,iR}} \\
    d_G = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n I_{c,iG}}{\sum_{i=1}^n I_{u,iG}} \\
    d_B = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n I_{c,iB}}{\sum_{i=1}^n I_{u,iB}} 
    \end{align*}
    This derivation accounts for the sum of errors across all pixels for each channel and is as performant as the gray-world method. Regarding being better than any 
    algorithm I might invent, I don't know. There are always opportunities for improvement. The diagonal mapping with the custom technique is better than oracle 
    illuminant and MaxRGB method, and has a comparable performance with the gray-world method. I also derived an LSQR solution described below, and the custom SSE 
    slightly outperforms the LSQR solution on some images (\autoref{tab:Table3}).
    \begin{align*}
    [d_R,d_G,d_B] &= [R_U(R_C^{-1}), G_U(G_C^{-1}), B_U(B_C^{-1})] \\
    D &= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    d_R & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & d_G & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & d_B
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    where \\
    - R,G,B - represent pixels across the red, green, and blue channels \\
    - U represents pixels from the unknown light \\
    - C represents pixels from the canonical light \\
    The RMS comparison between my \textbf{custom formula} and the LSQR diagonal matrix solution is shown in \autoref{tab:Table3}.

    I was encountering errors using the \emph{fminunc()} in Matlab. Irrespective of the starting point, I encountered the error below
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Matlab]
    Initial point is a local minimum.
    Optimization completed because the size of the gradient at the 
    initial point is less than the value of the optimality tolerance.
    \end{lstlisting}
    I was able to get \emph{fminsearch()} to work. I used two starting points, namely the oracle illuminant from QA5 and the custom SSE solution from Q9. The optimization 
    algorithm improved the results by a few decimal points but the precision is below the number of significant numbers required for this report, hence the values look 
    very similar. \\
    The RMS comparison when I used the oracle illuminant is shown in \autoref{tab:Table4}, while the RMS comparison for the custom SSE diagonal matrix startpoint is shown 
    in \autoref{tab:Table5}. In the report, both tables look exactly the same but the start point affects the optimal solution and the custom SSE start point solution was 
    more precise than the oracle illuminant start point. I could barely improve on the results from B9.
