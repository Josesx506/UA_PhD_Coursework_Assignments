Questions from Part A - C were completed in matlab and saved in the \emph{hw12.m} program. The program creates an \emph{output} folder to save images, so that the 
root directory is not always cluttered, and it can be run using the \textit{hw12()} command. 

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[Part A.] The script reads in the Line2 data and fits a line to it (\autoref{fig:Figure1}). The resulting line equation was $0.221x + 0.423y + -0.879 = 0$, with 
    a perpendicular distance error of 9.5. 111 inlier points were identified out of a total of 300 points.

        \caption{RANSAC fit on Line2 data using the threshold method after 100 iterations.}
        \label{fig:Figure1}
    \end{figure}

    \item[Part B.] Using the synthetic dataset for 10 samples between $(0,1)$, the homography transformation RMS error for 4, 5, and 6 points was 0.257, 0.255, and 0.252 
    respectively. This indicates that using more points can help to reduce the transformation error, and verifies that the implemented DLT method is working.  

    I manually selected 8 keypoints for the slide/frame pairs from \emph{hw9}. 4 of the selected points were used to compute the homography matrix, and the resulting matrix 
    was used to predict on the holdout points. The results are shown in \Cref{fig:Figure2,fig:Figure3,fig:Figure4}. The clicked keypoints are shown as purple circles on the 
    frame images (right). The original keypoints on the slide image and homography transformed points on the frame image are shown as red squares, connected by yellow lines.

        \caption{Homography projections for image pair 2. Annotation descriptions are described in preceding paragraph.}

    \end{figure}


    \item[Part C.]  RANSAC was used to improve keypoint matching. The source and destination keypoints were extracted from SIFT features, by computing the Euclidean distance with a 
    Lowe ratio cutoff of 0.8. Four random points were used to compute RANSAC for 100 iterations. Reprojection errors were computed from homography transformations, and inlier matches 
    are plotted in \Cref{fig:Figure5,fig:Figure6,fig:Figure7}. Comparing the reconstruction error with and without RANSAC shows that the RANSAC implementation improves the accuracy of 
    projected keypoints (This is printed in the matlab script). Image pairs 1 and 3 provided very good responses compared to image 2.
