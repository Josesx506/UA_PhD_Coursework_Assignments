Questions from Part A-B were completed in matlab and saved in the \emph{hw6.m} program, while the optional \emph{part C} was derived within the report. The 
program creates an \emph{output} folder to save images, so that the root directory is not always cluttered, and it can be run using the \textit{hw6()} command.
This prints the results to coding questions within terminal.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[Part-A1.]
    \ \\
    The light direction matrix was read into matlab using the \emph{readmatrix()} function. Seven photometric images were imported and flattened across 
    RGB channels to create a matrix (400,400,7). Two nested loops were used to iterate over each pixel in the image and the intensity across the 7 images 
    was saved in a $I$ matrix with dimensions (7,1). The normal matrix $N$ was derived from \autoref{eqn:Equation1}, where $N=\rho \times \hat{n}$.
    \begin{equation}
    \tag{1}
    I = \rho \times \hat{n} \cdot s
    \label{eqn:Equation1}
    \end{equation}
    Because more than 3 images were provided $s$ is not a square matrix, and the normal matrix $N$ had to calculated using the least squares estimation method 
    $N = (s^T s)^{-1} s^T I$. The resulting normal vector was converted into a unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ by dividing the normal vector by the albedo 
    $\hat{n} = \frac{N}{\rho} = \frac{N}{\lVert N \rVert}$, providing solutions for both the \emph{image normals} and \emph{albedo}. The canonical image was 
    generated by assuming the light direction was fixed at $(0,0,1)$ and iterating over two nested loops to calculate the intensity at each pixel with 
    \autoref{eqn:Equation1}. The resulting image is documented in \autoref{fig:Figure1}.

    \begin{figure}[H]

    \ \\
    The depth map of the surface was generated by integrating the partial derivatives of the normal matrix along all rows and columns. The origin was defined 
    at the top-left of the image and the resulting surface is shown in \autoref{fig:Figure2}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{output/f2_surface_depth_map.png}

        \label{fig:Figure2}
    \end{figure}

    The surface map can be estimated using 2 nested for loop to define its path but I used \emph{cumsum()} and \emph{repmat()} because they were faster and the 
    resulting output was similar.

    \item[Part-A3.]
    \ \\
    From the 3D surface, the white quadrants of the image have higher pixel values ~250, while darker quadrants in the top right and bottom left have lower pixel 
    values. When compared to the 3D surface, bright pixel quadrants have a maxima ~50 while dark quadrants have a minima of ~-50. This suggests that peaks are 
    associated with bright pixels and valleys are associated with dim pixels.

    \item[Part-A4.]
    \ \\
    The normal of the 3D surface was estimated using \emph{surfnorm()}, and the resulting normal matrix was used to recompute the canonical image with 
    \autoref{eqn:Equation1}, assuming the camera position was still fixed at (0,0,1). The resulting surface normals had to be rotated to align it with the orientation 
    of the image. The main result is shown in \autoref{fig:Figure3}, and different light directions were tested to replicate the patterns observed in the input 7 images.

    Validation tests were done to generate the shading for each of the seven input images using the light directions combined with the inverted normal matrix for 
    each pixel. Inverted images showed similar patterns with the input images with the overlying checkerboard patterns. An example plot is shown in \autoref{fig:Figure4} 
    implying that the overprinted patterns are not artifacts. In the image, the original \textbf{input 2} image is shown on the left, while the reconstructed image 
    using the light 2 direction $[0.27872325,0.34950790,0.89451528]$ (exceeds the required significant figures to maintain consistency) and inverted normal matrix is 
    shown on the right.

    The light color and light direction matrices were combined along each channel algebraically, to create 3 imagined light matrices. The imagined light matrix 
    is a weighted combination of the 5 original lights 
    \begin{align*}
    L_R = \sum_{i=1}^5 R_i \cdot L_i \\
    L_G = \sum_{i=1}^5 G_i \cdot L_i \\
    L_B = \sum_{i=1}^5 B_i \cdot L_i
    \end{align*}
    where \( (R_i,G_i,B_i) \) are the red, green, and blue components of the \(i^{-th}\) light and \( L_i \) is the light direction. Using the imagined source, 
    the normal directions of the weighted light sources were obtained. Because the albedo is expected to be 1 (pure white), the normal vector was not converted to 
    a unit vector. The final normal vector was integrated along rows and columns to generate depth maps for the photometric surfaces, which are shown in 
    \autoref{fig:Figure5}.

    Validation tests were done similar to Part A, however, only the brightness could be obtained and the original RGB could not be reconstructed.

    The BRDF's (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) \( \mathbf{g} \) can be simplified as the dot product between the incident light ray vector \(i\), 
    and the reflected light ray vector \(r\).
    $$\mathbf{g} = i \cdot r$$
    The light ray vectors can be expressed as angles, relating them to the zenith angle \( \theta_0 \) and azimuth angle \( \phi_0 \). Assuming that \( \phi_0 = 0 \),
    \begin{flalign*}
    &\mathbf{i} = \left( \sin\theta_0, 0, \cos\theta_0 \right) \\
    &\mathbf{o} = \left( \sin\theta \cos\phi, \sin\theta \sin\phi, \cos\theta \right)
    \end{flalign*}
    The dot product of the \(i\) and \(r\) vectors gives
    \begin{flalign*}
    \mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{r} &= (\sin\theta_0, 0, \cos\theta_0) \cdot (\sin\theta \cos\phi, \sin\theta \sin\phi, \cos\theta) \\
    &= \sin\theta_0 \sin\theta \cos\phi + \cos\theta_0 \cos\theta
    \end{flalign*}
    Assuming that the BRDF function \( \mathbf{g} \) depends solely on the cosine of the angle between the incident and reflected vectors, it can be expressed as 
    $$\mathbf{g}(\phi, \phi_0, \theta, \theta_0) = f(\mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{r}) = f\left( \sin\theta_0 \sin\theta \cos\phi + \cos\theta_0 \cos\theta \right)$$
    Here, \( f \) is a function that represents the specific reflectance model (such as Lambertian reflection, Cook-Torrance, etc.). This general form can be further 
    simplified by considering the difference between the zenith angles as \( \Delta = \theta_i - \theta_0 \).  

    To substitute \( \Delta = \theta_i - \theta_0 \) into the general form of \( \mathbf{g} \), we can rewrite \( \theta_i \) as \( \theta_i = \theta_0 + \Delta \), 
    $$g(\phi_i, \phi_0, \Delta) = f\left( \sin\theta_0 \sin(\theta_0 + \Delta) \cos(\phi_i - \phi_0) + \cos\theta_0 \cos(\theta_0 + \Delta) \right)$$
    Using the trigonometric identities for sums of sines and cosines \\
    1. \( \sin(\theta_0 + \Delta) = \sin\theta_0 \cos\Delta + \cos\theta_0 \sin\Delta \) \\
    2. \( \cos(\theta_0 + \Delta) = \cos\theta_0 \cos\Delta - \sin\theta_0 \sin\Delta \) \\
    We can simplify the substitution into $g$ further as 
    \begin{flalign*}
    g(\phi_i, \phi_0, \Delta) = &f (\sin\theta_0 \left( \sin\theta_0 \cos\Delta + \cos\theta_0 \sin\Delta \right) \cos(\phi_i - \phi_0) + \\
    &\cos\theta_0 \left( \cos\theta_0 \cos\Delta - \sin\theta_0 \sin\Delta \right))
    \end{flalign*}
    The resulting terms are grouped and expanded to become
    \begin{flalign*}
    g(\phi_i, \phi_0, \Delta) = &f( \sin^2\theta_0 \cos\Delta \cos(\phi_i - \phi_0) + \sin\theta_0 \cos\theta_0 \sin\Delta \cos(\phi_i - \phi_0) + \\
    & \cos^2\theta_0 \cos\Delta - \cos\theta_0 \sin\theta_0 \sin\Delta )
    \end{flalign*}
    Terms involving \( \cos\Delta \) and \( \sin\Delta \) can be grouped to obtain 
    \begin{flalign*}
    g(\phi_i, \phi_0, \Delta) = &f( \left( \sin^2\theta_0 \cos(\phi_i - \phi_0) + \cos^2\theta_0 \right) \cos\Delta + \\
    & \left( \sin\theta_0 \cos\theta_0 \cos(\phi_i - \phi_0) - \cos\theta_0 \sin\theta_0 \right) \sin\Delta )
    \end{flalign*}
    This indicates that $g$ is generally equivalent to $g(\phi_i, \phi_0, \Delta)$, and this updated expression, can be inverted to become  
    $\Delta = \Delta(\phi_i, \phi_0, g)$.
