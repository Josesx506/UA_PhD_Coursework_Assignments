\centerline{\it CS 577}
\centerline{\it HW \#2 Submission}
\centerline{\it Name: Joses Omojola}

Eight out of 9 questions were answered in the \emph{hw2.m} file. The file creates an \emph{output} folder to save images, 
so that the root directory is not always cluttered. Figures are saved and automatically closed when the script is run to
minimize the number of open windows. The script can be run by specifying all the names of the 3 files as input arguments 
to the function $ n\_qsts = hw2('rgb\_sensors.txt','light\_spectra.txt','responses.txt');$. Programming was completed with 
Matlab R2024a, and it took me roughly 20 hours to complete the assignment (Coding + Exposition).

Text files were read into matlab using the \emph{importdata()} function, nested functions were used to reduce repeated 
code, and subplots were used where necessary to minimize output files. Titles were included to differentiate the purpose 
of each subplot and question numbers are denoted with a "Q" prefix in the text below. The bonus question was omitted due 
to time constraints.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[Q1.]

    The random seed was set to "477" for reproducibility and the input sensors are from the \emph{rgb\_sensors.txt} file is shown 
    below in \autoref{fig:Figure1}. The blue channel is most sensitive at short wavelengths, while the red channel is 
    sensitive at longer wavelengths.

    The simulated light spectra was scaled by \textbf{9.4e-4} to adjust the input range between 0-255. The RGB response was obtained 
    by multiplying the spectra with the sensor sensitivity. The array was reshaped to match the assignment instructions and the 
    results are shown in \autoref{fig:Figure1}. The sensitivity spectrum is optimized to improve indoor lighting hence the bias 
    towards blue.

    \item[Q2.]

    The least-squares method was used to invert for the sensor sensitivities with the \emph{linsolve()} function in matlab.
    The inverted results are compared to the original sensitivities in \autoref{fig:Figure2}. A near perfect match was obtained 
    and a direct overlay didn't show any differences, hence the split across the multiple subplots.

    \end{figure}

    The summary of the obtained errors are shown in \autoref{tab:Table1}. The blue channel spectrum has the highest error, while 
    the errors are generally lower across other channels including the total rgb response error. From the minor errors encountered, 
    the estimated sensors can precisely reconstruct the RGB.

    \begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}

    \label{tab:Table1}
    \end{center}
    \end{table}

    \item[Q3.]

    Additional tests were run by adding random noise with a standard deviation of 10 to the estimated rgb response while inverting 
    for the sensor sensitivity spectra. Comparison between unclipped and clipped rgb values before inverting for sensitivity is 
    shown in \autoref{fig:Figure3}.

        \label{fig:Figure3}
    \end{figure}

    \FloatBarrier

    The summary RMS errors are shown in \autoref{tab:Table2}. At low noise standard deviations, the influence of clipping is 
    minimal on the sensors, however; the reconstructed RGB from the clipped input is more accurate.

    \begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}

    \item[Q4.]

    The noise levels were consistently increased to identify thresholds at which the rgb cannot be accurately recovered, and 
    extend the tests about clipped vs. unclipped RGB levels. Values of the noise std. were increased according to the intervals 
    specified in \autoref{tab:Table3}.

    At high noise levels, like standard deviations of 50 and 100, the recovered sensor sensitivity is very noisy and hardly 
    accurate \autoref{fig:Figure4}. Below a noise std. of 30, the clipped and unclipped rms errors are comparable, 
    however the clipped RGB level errors begin to plateau as the noise std. approaches 200, while the unclipped results 
    continue to linearly increase \autoref{fig:Figure5}.

    \item[Q5.] 

    Gamma correction depends on the relationship $I_{perceived} = I_{raw}^{\gamma}$ between the input signal and the 
    displayed intensity. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] $I_{perceived}$ is the perceived intensity (normalized between 0 and 1).
        \item[-] $I_{raw}$ is the actual raw intensity value (also normalized between 0 and 1).
        \item[-] $\gamma$ is the gamma value.
    \end{itemize}

    The perceived intensity of 80 is normalized by 255 to get $I_{perceived} = 0.3137$. The gamma value can be derived 
    by taking the log of both sides 
    $$
    \gamma = \frac {log(I_{perceived})} {{log(I_{raw})}} = \frac {log(0.3137)} {{log(0.5)}} = 1.67
    $$
    The gamma value of 1.67 indicates that the perceived intensity is disproportionately lower than the raw intensity.
    By applying a  correction with this value, the display's response can be adjusted to make the perceived intensity 
    more linear with the raw intensity.

    \item[Q6.] 

    The camera sensitivity in Q6 was inverted using the files provided for HW2. The recovered sensitivity is noisy and 
    notably different from the original sensitivities \autoref{fig:Figure6}. The overall sensor RMS error obtained was 
    \emph{1013791.700635} while a high RGB RMS value of \emph{11.979092} was obtained.

        \caption{Inverted sensor sensitivity from light sensor dataset.}
        \label{fig:Figure6}
    \end{figure}

    \FloatBarrier

    Potential causes of the large errors include the non-negative camera sensitivities in \autoref{fig:Figure6}.
    Because the linear inversion is unconstrained during optimization, negative values are derived, and the result 
    does not resemble the true camera sensitivities. Additional issues could be related with using an incorrect 
    sensor data when estimating the RGB response, leading to compounding errors.

    \item[Q7.] 

    Constrained least-squares inversion was performed using the \emph{quadprog()} function in matlab. The lower 
    bound of the optimization was set to zero, ensuring that non-negative sensitivities were adjusted during the 
    inversion. The results are shown in \autoref{fig:Figure7}. The overall sensor RMS error reduced (5x) to 
    \emph{17253.1992} while a lower RGB RMS value of \emph{9.9574} was obtained. The resulting solution is not 
    smooth, and has multiple spikes which can be smoothed out during the inversion step.

    \item[Q8.] 

    To smooth the inversion, a matrix $m_{i}^{T}$ was used. If $i = 0$, the difference matrix M becomes
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    M = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & ... & 0 \\
    0 & ... & 0 \\
    0 & ... & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    -

    $$
    where the $1$ and $-1$ are in positions $i$ and $i+1$, respectively. The real light energy spectra $A$ can 
    be augmented with $A_{aug} = [A; \lambda * M]$. By adjusting the $\lambda$ values, we can smoothen our constrained lsqr inversion 
    to improve the estimated sensor curves across the 3 channels.  
    
    Tests were performed with 5 lambda values $\lambda = [0, 0.01, 0.0225, 0.1, 1];$ and plots of the resulting sensor sensitivities 
    are shown in \autoref{fig:Figure8}. The rms errors are documented in \autoref{tab:Table4}. The lowest errors were gotten with a 
    lambda value of \textbf{0.0225}, and $\lambda$ values above 0.1 were generally too smooth.
