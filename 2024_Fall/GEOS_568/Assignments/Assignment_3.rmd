1. Comparison of radiation patterns.
    a. The equations for the far-field equation for a double couple source from AR 4.33 are
        \begin{align*}
        A^{FP} &= sin2 \theta \ cos \phi \ \hat{r} \\
        A^{FS} &= cos2 \theta \ cos \phi \ \hat{\theta} - cos \theta \ sin \phi \ \hat{\phi}
        \end{align*}
        The plots in the $x_1 - x_3$ and $x_1 - x_2$ planes are shown in figure \@ref(fig:fig1).

        knitr::include_graphics("output/double-couple_rad_ptn.png")
        ```
    b. The far-field p- and s- wave displacements for a single couple EGF in a homogenous isotropic unbounded medium from AR 4.24-4.25 is 
        \begin{align*}
        u_i^p (x,t) &= \frac{1}{4 \pi \rho \alpha^2} \gamma_i \gamma_j \frac{1}{r} X_0 \left( t - \frac{r}{\alpha} \right) \\
        u_i^s (x,t) &= \frac{1}{4 \pi \rho \beta^2} (\delta_{ij} - \gamma_i \gamma_j) \frac{1}{r} X_0 \left( t - \frac{r}{\beta} \right)
        \end{align*}
        The radiation patterns for both body waves are determined by the cosine direction terms $\gamma_i \gamma_j \text{ and } (\delta_{ij} - \gamma_i \gamma_j)$.
        Considering the fault normal direction $\upsilon = (0,0,1)$ indicates that the fault plane is horizontal and slip $u=(u,0,0)$ 
        movement is along the $x$-direction, we can use the relation
        $$\gamma = (sin \theta cos \phi, sin \theta sin \phi, cos \theta)$$
        The fault slip can be expressed as \(M_{ij} = \upsilon_i u_j\), or equivalently:
        $$
        M_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & u \\
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$
        For the radiation pattern, we compute:
        $$R^P \propto \gamma_i M_{ij} \gamma_j.$$
        Substituting $M_{ij}$ into this expression:
        $$R^P \propto \gamma_1 \gamma_3.$$
        Substituting \(M_{ij}\)
        $$
        u_i^P \propto \gamma_i \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & u \\
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        \gamma_1 \\ \gamma_2 \\ \gamma_3
        \end{bmatrix} = 
        \gamma_i \begin{bmatrix}
        u \gamma_3 \\ 0 \\ 0
        \end{bmatrix}.
        $$
        which reduces to $u_i^P \propto u \gamma_1 \gamma_3$. In spherical coordinates, using the definition of $\gamma$, this becomes:
        $$R^P \propto \gamma_1 \gamma_3 = \sin \theta \ \cos \phi \ \cos \theta.$$
        The $S$-wave displacement radiation pattern is proportional to:
        $$u_i^S \propto (\delta_{ij} - \gamma_i \gamma_j),$$
        This can be simplified to spherical coordinates for $S_H$:
        $$R^S_H \propto \sin\phi \cos\theta$$
        and $S_V$ (vertical $S$-wave):
        $$R^S_V \propto \cos\phi \cos\theta$$
        ```{r fig2, fig.cap = "Single-couple far-field p-wave radiation patterns.", out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
        knitr::include_graphics("output/single-couple_rad_ptn.png")
        ```
    c. The single and double-couple p-wave radiation patterns both have four lobes and are similar (Figures \@ref(fig:fig1)-\@ref(fig:fig2))
    along the $x_1-x_3$ plane. They exhibit differences in the $x_1-x_2$ plane where the single-couple p-wave has amplitudes that are absent 
    in the double-couple solution. The s-wave radiation patterns are different with the single-couple solution exhibiting a two-lobed pattern 
    (figure \@ref(fig:fig2)) along the $x_1-x_3$ plane, while the double-couple solution has four lobes (figure \@ref(fig:fig1)). This indicates 
    that p-wave radiation patterns cannot be differentiated in the $x_1-x_3$ plane, and s-wave radiation patterns can be differentiated along 
    both planes.

2. The far-field radiation patterns and displacements from AR 4.89-4.92 were coded in python, and the variable names are defined 
 in the appendix section \@ref(sec-appendix). The strike, dip, and rake of the fault was obtained from the USGS webpage. The scalar 
 moment from the USGS page $M_0 = 1.046e+18 N-m$, was used to approximate the shear modulus and fault area since $M_0 = \mu AD$. 
 Average wave velocities and density were set to 
 \begin{align*}
 \alpha &= 9.5 km/s \\ 
 \beta &= 4.9 km/s \\ 
 \rho &= 2.7 kg/m^3
 \end{align*}
 Azimuths and take-off angles for individual phases were modeled using ***taup***, and the *ak135* 1D velocity model. For event-station 
 pairs with multiple arrivals, the first arrival was used. The slip was modeled as a heaviside function, and convolved 
 with a source time function (first derivative of a gaussian) to simulate synthetic displacement amplitudes.
 
    Seismic waveforms were downloaded for 4 broadband stations located $7-15^o$ from the event epicenter (figure \@ref(fig:fig3)). 
    The vertical components of the waveforms (BHZ) were selected and the instrument response was removed to obtain displacement 
    amplitudes. Constant body-wave velocities for approximating the arrival times are not very accurate at extended distances, so 
    the synthetic phase arrivals do not match perfectly. Arrivals can be better approximated with the 1D velocity model as shown 
    in the top waveform panels in figure \@ref(fig:fig3). The raw and simulated phases of the p- and s- arrivals have similar 
    polarities but the amplitdes do not match. This can be attributed to the approximated shear modulus and fault area that were 
    multiplied with the radiation patterns even though the $M_0$ already has a displacement term.  

    All four stations have negative p-polarites. The two eastern stations (AFI and NIUE) have negative s-polarities, while the two 
    western stations (NOUC and SANVU) have positive s-polarities \@ref(fig:fig3). The synthetic displacement waveforms do not adequately 
    resolve the sidelobes like the small early negative phase in the s-polarities on the western stations but it provides an approximate 
    estimate of the dominant polarities for both phases. A single synthetic displacement waveform can be obtained by adding 
    $u^{total} = u^P + u^{SV} + u^{SH}$. Total displacement amplitudes depend on polarity directions from the s-waves because opposite 
    $u^{SV} \text{ and } u^{SH}$ amplitudes can cancel out each other.
