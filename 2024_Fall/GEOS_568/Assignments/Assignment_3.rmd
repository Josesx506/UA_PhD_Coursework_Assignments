1. Comparison of radiation patterns.
    a. The equations for the far-field equation for a double couple source from AR 4.33 are
        \begin{align*}
        A^{FP} &= sin2 \theta \ cos \phi \ \hat{r} \\
        A^{FS} &= cos2 \theta \ cos \phi \ \hat{\theta} - cos \theta \ sin \phi \ \hat{\phi}
        \end{align*}
        The plots in the $x_1 - x_3$ and $x_1 - x_2$ planes are shown in figure \@ref(fig:fig1).

        ```{r fig1, fig.cap = "Double-couple far-field p-wave radiation patterns.", out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
        knitr::include_graphics("output/double-couple_rad_ptn.png")
        ```
    b. 
        ```{r fig2, fig.cap = "Single-couple far-field p-wave radiation patterns.", out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
        knitr::include_graphics("output/single-couple_rad_ptn.png")
        ```
    c. The single and double-couple p-wave radiation patterns both have four lobes and are similar (Figures \@ref(fig:fig1)-\@ref(fig:fig2)). 
    The s-wave radiation patterns are different with the single-couple solution exhibiting a two-lobed pattern (figure \@ref(fig:fig2)), 
    while the double-couple solution has four lobes (figure \@ref(fig:fig1)). This indicates that p-wave radiation patterns cannot be 
    differentiated, and s-wave radiation patterns can be differentiated for both type of solutions.

2. The far-field radiation patterns and displacements from AR 4.89-4.92 were coded in python, and the variable names are defined 
 in the appendix section \@ref(sec-appendix). The strike, dip, and rake of the fault was obtained from the USGS webpage. The scalar 
 moment from the USGS page $M_0 = 1.046e+18 N-m$, was used to approximate the shear modulus and fault area since $M_0 = \mu AD$. 
 Average wave velocities and density were set to 
 \begin{align*}
 \alpha &= 9.5 km/s \\ 
 \beta &= 4.9 km/s \\ 
 \rho &= 2.7 kg/m^3
 \end{align*}
 Azimuths and take-off angles for individual phases were modeled using ***taup***, and the *ak135* 1D velocity model. For event-station 
 pairs with multiple arrivals, the first arrival was used. The slip was modeled as a heaviside function, and convolved 
 with a source time function (first derivative of a gaussian) to simulate synthetic displacement amplitudes.
 
    Seismic waveforms were downloaded for 4 broadband stations located $7-15^o$ from the event epicenter (figure \@ref(fig:fig3)). 
    The vertical components of the waveforms (BHZ) were selected and the instrument response was removed to obtain displacement 
    amplitudes. Constant body-wave velocities for approximating the arrival times are not very accurate at extended distances, so 
    the synthetic phase arrivals do not match perfectly. Arrivals can be better approximated with the 1D velocity model as shown 
    in the top waveform panels in figure \@ref(fig:fig3). The raw and simulated phases of the p- and s- arrivals have similar 
    polarities but the amplitdes do not match. This can be attributed to the approximated shear modulus and fault area that were 
    multiplied with the radiation patterns even though the $M_0$ already has a displacement term.  

    All four stations have negative p-polarites. The two eastern stations (AFI and NIUE) have negative s-polarities, while the two 
    western stations (NOUC and SANVU) have positive s-polarities \@ref(fig:fig3). The synthetic displacement waveforms do not adequately 
    resolve the sidelobes like the small early negative phase in the s-polarities on the western stations but it provides an approximate 
    estimate of the dominant polarities for both phases. A single synthetic displacement waveform can be obtained by adding 
    $u^{total} = u^P + u^{SV} + u^{SH}$. Total displacement amplitudes depend on polarity directions from the s-waves because opposite 
    $u^{SV} \text{ and } u^{SH}$ amplitudes can cancel out each other.

    ```{r fig3, fig.cap = "Event station locations with observed (top) and predicted (bottom) displacement waveforms. P- and S- arrivals calculated with the ak135 1D model.", out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}

- $\dot{\overline{u}}$ is the particle velocity at the source, averaged over fault area A and evaluated
at retarded time $t - \frac{r}{\alpha}$.
- $\gamma$ is the longitudinal direction from the source at $\xi$ to the receiver at $x$.
- $\phi_s$ - strike angle
- $\delta$ - dip angle
- $\lambda$ - rake angle
- $i_{\xi}$ - take-off angle
- $\phi$ - source-receiver azimuth (measured clockwise from North (the x-axis))
- $\alpha$ - p-wave velocity
- $\beta$ - s-wave velocity
- $r$ - hypocentral distance
